# School District Planning and Facilities Management Test Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains two test scripts demonstrating advanced approaches to school district planning and facilities management. These scripts are designed as proof-of-concept models and are not intended for direct real-world application without further development and customization.

1. **GNN-Enhanced Multi-Option School District Facility Planning System**
2. **Facilities Management and Maintenance Prediction System**

## Purpose

The purpose of these test scripts is to showcase how advanced data analysis techniques, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and predictive modeling, can be applied to school district planning and facilities management. They serve as starting points for developing more comprehensive, production-ready systems.

## Scripts Description

### 1. GNN-Enhanced Multi-Option School District Facility Planning System

This script demonstrates the use of Graph Neural Networks to analyze school district data and generate optimized facility improvement plans.

Key features:
- Creation of a graph representation of the school district
- GNN-based analysis of school relationships and characteristics
- Generation of multiple improvement options
- Ranking of options based on various criteria

### 2. Facilities Management and Maintenance Prediction System

This script showcases predictive maintenance and facilities optimization techniques for school districts.

Key features:
- Predictive modeling for future maintenance needs
- Optimization of facility usage
- Analysis of maintenance trends
- Simulation of school schedules

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/crashidian/RandomScriptsForCS.git
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install torch torch-geometric numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

### Running the Scripts

1. Navigate to the script directory:
   ```
   cd school-district-planning-tests
   ```

2. Run the GNN-Enhanced Planning script:
   ```
   python gnn_school_planning.py
   ```

3. Run the Facilities Management script:
   ```
   python facilities_management.py
   ```

## Important Notes

- These scripts are test files and should not be used for actual decision-making without substantial modification and validation.
- The data used in these scripts is simulated. Real-world application would require integration with actual school district data.
- The models and algorithms used are simplified for demonstration purposes. Production use would require more robust implementations and extensive testing.

## Potential Real-World Adaptations

To adapt these scripts for real-world scenarios:

1. Integrate with actual school district databases and GIS systems.
2. Enhance data preprocessing and cleaning mechanisms.
3. Implement more sophisticated financial modeling.
4. Develop user interfaces for easier interaction and visualization.
5. Incorporate additional factors such as demographic trends, zoning laws, and community feedback.
6. Implement rigorous testing and validation procedures.
7. Ensure compliance with relevant educational and building regulations.
